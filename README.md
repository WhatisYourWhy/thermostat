# Go Thermostat

This is a simple thermostat I've thrown together out of necessity (our previous one blew a capacitor and I had a raspberry pi lying around).  

Roadmap:
- add a web interface for control
- converge on embd library for GPIO access (it was getting colder and embd wasn't working)
- cleaner shutdown
